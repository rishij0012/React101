- points to remember 👍
    🤜 here we have covered side effect by the input from the user ... to check form is valid or not.
    🤜 use REDUCER to manage complex state of the app ... like forms 
                        CONTEXT
    - manage the app wide state through component
    - e.g like authentication , theme 
    - use context will get the value from nearest provider in the tree if not then default value provided in at time of creation of context is used


    - limitation : 
        - only used for low freq changes 
        - not all places used context like button configuration ... on lcick property in the app
